# Stable checkpoints

Checkpoint entries are chronological and must include commit SHA, parent, scope, exact verification, result, and rollback instruction.

## Baseline documentation

- Commit SHA: `71b6ba396b60b79ed0cf2bdfb8c31ab7f7c76ce0`
- Parent SHA: `609270f533666e7636d11f7d16590be925ec836f`
- Scope: baseline evidence and migration rollback documents only
- Verification: `validateTargetRegistry`, clean `buildAllSupported`, direct `verifyExistingArtifacts`, focused tests, PackIndex benchmark; runtime smoke limitations recorded
- Status: `FOCUSED_VERIFIED`
- Rollback: no functional behavior changed; revert the baseline documentation commit if necessary

## Registry schema v2

- Commit SHA: to be recorded immediately after the registry checkpoint commit
- Parent SHA: `bfd63ce2549f81731f5ba05a4e7cfeeeeb627c20`
- Scope: schema v2 fields, checked-in 22-release sequence/cells, maturity policy, and resolved-matrix task
- Verification: `./gradlew.bat validateTargetRegistry printResolvedMatrix buildTarget -Ppackforge_target=mc1_21_1 --no-daemon --stacktrace`; final focused build and all three child artifact verifiers passed
- Status: `FOCUSED_VERIFIED`
- Rollback: revert the registry checkpoint; schema v1 baseline is parent commit plus the documentation checkpoint
